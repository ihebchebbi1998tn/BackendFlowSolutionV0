## Business Logic

### Service Order Creation
1. Generate unique order number (SO-XXXXXXXX)
2. Set initial status (draft/scheduled)
3. Create service order record
4. Create associated jobs
5. Calculate estimated costs
6. Log creation activity

### Create from Sale
1. Validate sale is completed
2. Generate new service order
3. Copy relevant information from sale
4. Create initial job
5. Set scheduled date
6. Link to installation if applicable

### Status Transitions
1. Draft → Scheduled (when technician assigned)
2. Scheduled → In Progress (when work starts)
3. In Progress → Completed (when work done)
4. Any → On Hold (pause work)
5. Any → Cancelled (cancel order)

### Approval Workflow
1. Complete all work
2. Submit for approval
3. Manager reviews
4. Approve or request changes
5. Generate invoice
6. Mark as completed

## Testing

### Sample cURL Commands

#### Create Service Order
\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST https://yourapi.com/api/v1/service-orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "draft",
    "priority": "high",
    "contactId": "CONT-001",
    "installationId": "INST-001",
    "description": "HVAC system maintenance and repair",
    "scheduledDate": "2025-02-01",
    "estimatedDuration": 4,
    "estimatedCost": 500.00,
    "currency": "TND",
    "jobs": [
      {
        "jobType": "maintenance",
        "description": "Regular maintenance check",
        "assignedTechnician": "Ahmed",
        "estimatedHours": 2
      }
    ]
  }'
\`\`\`

#### Create from Sale
\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST https://yourapi.com/api/v1/service-orders/from-sale \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "saleId": "SALE-001",
    "scheduledDate": "2025-02-01",
    "priority": "high"
  }'
\`\`\`

#### Get Service Orders
\`\`\`bash
curl -X GET "https://yourapi.com/api/v1/service-orders?status=scheduled&page=1&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
\`\`\`

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexes**: All frequently queried fields are indexed
2. **Pagination**: Always use pagination for list endpoints
3. **Eager Loading**: Related data is included via `.Include()`
4. **Computed Columns**: Database computes costs automatically

## Security

- All endpoints require authentication (`[Authorize]` attribute)
- User ID extracted from JWT claims
- All activities logged with user information
- Cascade delete ensures data integrity
