## Database Schema

### Tables
1. **sales** - Main sales table

PATCH  /api/v1/sales/{id}           - Update sale
DELETE /api/v1/sales/{id}           - Delete sale
\`\`\`

### Sale Items
\`\`\`
GET    /api/v1/sales/{id}/activities        - Get activities
POST   /api/v1/sales/{id}/items             - Add item

\`\`\`

## Query Parameters

### GET /api/v1/sales
- `status`: Filter by status (new_offer, won, lost, redefined, draft, sent, accepted, completed, cancelled)
- `stage`: Filter by stage (offer, negotiation, closed, converted)
- `priority`: Filter by priority (low, medium, high, urgent)
- `contact_id`: Filter by contact
- `date_from`: Filter from date (ISO 8601)
- `date_to`: Filter to date (ISO 8601)
- `search`: Search in title, contact name, description
- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `limit`: Items per page (default: 20)
- `sort_by`: Field to sort by (default: updated_at)
- `sort_order`: asc or desc (default: desc)

## Conversion from Offers

### POST /api/v1/sales/from-offer
Creates an exact copy of an offer as a sale. This is the primary way to convert accepted offers into sales.

**Request Body:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "offerId": "OFFER-001",
  "status": "won",
  "priority": "high"
}
\`\`\`

**Process:**
1. Fetches the complete offer with all items
2. Creates a new sale with identical data
3. Copies all offer items to sale items
4. Sets sale status to "won" and stage to "closed"
5. Links sale back to original offer via `offer_id`
6. Updates offer status to "accepted" and sets `converted_to_sale_id`
7. Adds "Converted" tag to sale
8. Returns the created sale

## Integration Points

### Dependencies
- ApplicationDbContext (EF Core)
- ILogger for logging
- Authorization middleware
- Offers module (for conversion)
- Contacts module (for contact info)

### Required Setup
1. Add SaleService to DI container in Program.cs:
   \`\`\`csharp
   builder.Services.AddScoped<ISaleService, SaleService>();
   \`\`\`
2. Register entity configurations in DbContext
3. Apply database migrations
4. Configure authorization policies

## Error Handling

### Error Codes
- `VALIDATION_ERROR` (400): Invalid request data
- `UNAUTHORIZED` (401): Not authenticated
- `FORBIDDEN` (403): Insufficient permissions
- `SALE_NOT_FOUND` (404): Sale doesn't exist
- `OFFER_NOT_FOUND` (404): Offer doesn't exist (for conversion)
- `ITEM_NOT_FOUND` (404): Item doesn't exist
- `INTERNAL_ERROR` (500): Server error

## Testing

### Sample cURL Commands

#### Create Sale from Offer
\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST https://yourapi.com/api/v1/sales/from-offer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "offerId": "OFFER-001",
    "status": "won",
    "priority": "high"
  }'
\`\`\`

#### Get Sales
\`\`\`bash
curl -X GET "https://yourapi.com/api/v1/sales?status=won&page=1&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
\`\`\`

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexes**: All frequently queried fields are indexed
2. **Pagination**: Always use pagination for list endpoints
3. **Eager Loading**: Items are included with sales via `.Include()`
4. **Computed Columns**: Database computes totals automatically

## Security

- All endpoints require authentication (`[Authorize]` attribute)
- User ID extracted from JWT claims
- All activities logged with user information
- Cascade delete ensures data integrity
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
