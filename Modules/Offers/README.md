## Validation Rules

### Offers
- `title`: Required, max 255 characters
- `contactName`: Required, max 255 characters
- `contactEmail`: Optional, valid email format
- `amount`: Required, >= 0
- `taxes`: Optional, >= 0

## Business Logic

### Offer Creation
1. Generate unique offer ID (OFFER-XXXXXXXX)
2. Set initial status (draft/sent)
3. Create offer record
4. Add items if provided
5. Trigger auto-calculation of amounts
6. Log creation activity

### Offer Update
1. Validate offer exists
2. Update only provided fields
3. Auto-update `updated_at` timestamp
4. Recalculate totals if financial fields changed
5. Log status changes automatically (via trigger)

### Offer Renewal
1. Duplicate original offer with new ID
2. Set status to "draft"
3. Copy all items
4. Reset conversion fields
5. Set new timestamps

### Offer Conversion
1. Update offer status to "accepted"
2. Generate Sale/Service Order IDs
3. Update conversion tracking fields
4. Return conversion results

## Integration Points

### Dependencies
- ApplicationDbContext (EF Core)
- ILogger for logging
- Authorization middleware

### Required Setup
1. Add OfferService to DI container
2. Register entity configurations in DbContext
3. Apply database migrations
4. Configure authorization policies

## Error Handling

### Error Codes
- `VALIDATION_ERROR` (400): Invalid request data
- `UNAUTHORIZED` (401): Not authenticated
- `FORBIDDEN` (403): Insufficient permissions
- `OFFER_NOT_FOUND` (404): Offer doesn't exist
- `ITEM_NOT_FOUND` (404): Item doesn't exist
- `INTERNAL_ERROR` (500): Server error

## Testing

### Sample cURL Commands

#### Create Offer
\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST https://yourapi.com/api/v1/offers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Offer",
    "contactId": "CONT-001",
    "contactName": "John Doe",
    "status": "draft",
    "currency": "TND",
    "items": [
      {
        "type": "service",
        "itemId": "SRV-001",
        "itemName": "Consulting",
        "quantity": 10,
        "unitPrice": 150.00
      }
    ]
  }'
\`\`\`

#### Get Offers
\`\`\`bash
curl -X GET "https://yourapi.com/api/v1/offers?status=sent&page=1&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
\`\`\`

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexes**: All frequently queried fields are indexed
2. **Pagination**: Always use pagination for list endpoints
3. **Eager Loading**: Items are included with offers via `.Include()`
4. **Computed Columns**: Database computes totals automatically

## Security

- All endpoints require authentication (`[Authorize]` attribute)
- User ID extracted from JWT claims
- All activities logged with user information
- Cascade delete ensures data integrity

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Email notifications for status changes
- [ ] PDF generation for offers
- [ ] Template management
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Bulk operations
- [ ] Export to Excel/CSV
- [ ] Workflow approvals
- [ ] Integration with external CRM systems
